### üìÅ Files & Directories in Qt6 ‚Äì Practical Examples  
This folder covers how to handle files and directories using Qt6. These examples include reading/writing files, working with metadata, checking permissions, and creating or listing directories.

All examples are console-based and use `QTextStream` for output. They're great for beginners exploring file handling and directory operations in Qt with C++.

### üß† What You‚Äôll Learn  
‚úÖ Reading from and writing to files using `QFile` and `QTextStream`  
‚úÖ Getting file metadata like size, path, suffix, and ownership  
‚úÖ Checking and displaying file permissions  
‚úÖ Copying, renaming, and creating files/directories  
‚úÖ Listing files and folders with sorting and formatting  
‚úÖ Printing standard paths (home, temp, current, root)

If you're using CMake, here's a basic structure to compile any of these:

```cmake
add_executable(readFile "FilesAndDirectories/readFile.cpp")
target_link_libraries(readFile Qt6::Core)
